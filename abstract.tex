\eat{Most modern applications access the network using communication libraries rather than traditional network APIs. This is because the current network stack is not extensible and hence cannot support the rich variety of connections, including ones that encrypt or serialize data, modern applications use. However, most communication libraries are not designed to compose with other libraries, and this limits their use.
Additionally, many communication libraries can only be used in specific deployments, and the use of these libraries impedes portability. In this paper, we argue that to resolve these shortcomings, we need an extensible and runtime-reconfigurable network stack. We propose a design for such a stack and prototype our design in a system named \name. We demonstrate the generality and benefit of our design using three case studies.
