Improving an application's performance and efficiency often requires specializing its use of network functionality to its runtime environment depending on where it runs, the requests it serves, and its performance goals.
Specializing applications in this way is challenging because developers need to choose the libraries they use when writing their program and cannot easily change them at runtime.
This paper thus introduces \name, which 
lets applications change communication library implementations
at runtime without limiting developer flexibility in the choice of communication functions.
\name allows applications to safely use optimized communication primitives (including ones with deployment limitations) without limiting deployability. Our evaluation shows cases where this enables specializations resulting in $16\times$ higher throughput and $63\%$ lower latency than current general-purpose approaches while imposing minimal overheads relative to hand-optimized versions that use deployment-specific communication primitives.
